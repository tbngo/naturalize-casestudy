        <h2><strong>Supporting Immigrants Seeking Citizenship: A Customized Checklist App for Naturalization Documents</strong></h2>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="seven columns subheader">
        <h4><strong>SUMMARY üìù</strong></h4>
        <h5 class="subheader">PROBLEM üí•</h5>
        <p>
          Naturalize addresses a common problem we came across in our research and interviews: the naturalization process is 
          filled with complicated paperwork and requires applicants to submit various documents, which can be overwhelming and 
          confusing, especially because every applicant has unique circumstances which may call for different, additional documents. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The application provides a simplified, customized checklist so users can see exactly which documents they are required to 
          gather and submit when applying for citizenship and keep track of them. To generate the checklist, the application first 
          asks a series of simple (yes or no) questions to ensure the user is eligible for naturalization, then another set of simple 
          (yes or no) questions about their life circumstances. Based on the user‚Äôs answers, the application will generate the appropriate 
          list of documents for the customized checklist which is produced after the questions are answered. 
        </p>
        <h5>NATURALIZE AS A PIT üèô</h5>
          <p>
            The naturalization process is heavily geared towards English-speaking, well-educated, and well-resourced people. Therefore, in 
            the design of our solution, we looked to serve those who are disadvantaged or left out by this process. These are people who cannot 
            afford a private lawyer but may rely on nonprofits or community organizations, who aren‚Äôt always comfortable speaking English, and 
            who find the language used in United States Citizenship and Immigration Services forms confusing and overwhelming. This led to decisions 
            in our design like asking simple yes or no questions with one question per page, trying to fit our application within the processes used 
            by non-profit organizations serving these populations, and storing data locally instead of through an account for privacy reasons. For 
            our team, public interest technology must think beyond a general ‚Äúpublic good‚Äù to identify a set of needs that are overlooked by the 
            design of the citizenship application process.

          The aims involved in designing a PIT product differ from the goals of designing regular commercial products in important ways. The priority 
          is not that the product will have enough broad appeal to sell, but that it will be helpful and have a real social impact on the people who 
          use it, and in our case those who are typically left out by the citizenship process. This means prioritizing scaling down to achieve actual 
          impact, versus scaling up for broad appeal but diffuse impact.

        <p>
          The target audience of our application, Naturalize, is the average citizenship-seeker in the United States: 
          a middle aged person who has had lawful permanent resident status for several years (the median number in 2018 
          for people naturalizing was seven years). Additionally, our typical user is from Mexico, the leading country of 
          origin among legal permanent residents applying for citizenship in 2015, and speaks and writes basic English. 
          It‚Äôs also important to keep in mind income: the median household income of citizens who naturalized in FY 2009-2014 
          period was $55,000 ‚Äì the same as that of the general population.

        <h5><b>RESEARCH üë©‚Äçüî¨</b></h5>
        <p>
          Our initial research was grounded in the question, ‚Äúhow can libraries improve access to social services?‚Äù We built our work up from there.
        </p>

        <img src="images/ResearchGraphic1.png" class="u-max-full-width center" alt="research graphic">

        <p>
          To gain specific insights from key stakeholders of the problem, we conducted:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>seven interviews with immigrants</strong> (from Vietnam, Korea, and the Dominican Republic and of various age groups) to the US on their experience 
            becoming citizens and their relationship with libraries
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>three interviews of librarians and library staffers</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>three user journey maps of immigrants</strong> using library immigrant services

        <p>
          Throughout this research process, one PIT question that influenced our design direction was the following: <strong>To what extent do you have shared knowledge and language with the community? If not, how will you bridge this gap?</strong> 
          Learning that we tended to limit the scope ourselves by focusing on English-centric insights and on users who were technologically active, and that library resources are also designed to match mainstream U.S. culture, our next steps were guided 
          by the goal to reduce the need for specialized knowledge (technology, legal jargon, cultural knowledge, English language) and to increase access for a variety of languages and cultural backgrounds.

        <h5><b>SYNTHESIS ‚öôÔ∏è</b></h5>
        <p>
          From the data-gathering and engagement process, we outlined nine key themes of needs and opportunities.
        </p>

        <img src="images/NineThemes.png" class="u-max-full-width center" style="padding-bottom: 5%;" alt="Nine Themes">

        <p>
          From these, we narrowed down to the three themes represented below based on the following key questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            What were the most frequently mentioned themes?
          </li>
          <li>
            Are these themes mutually exclusive or can we hit two birds with one stone?
          </li>
          <li>
            Ultimately, what do our stakeholders and users need the most? That is, which topics were they most urgent or passionate about?
          </li>
          <li>
            Where can we make a lasting impact for at least one person rather than purposeless attempts for a large group of people?
          </li>
        </ul>

        <img src="images/NarrowedThreeThemesAffinityMap.png" class="u-max-full-width center" alt="affinity map">

        <p>
          These three themes led to our 3 <i>How Might We</i> statements:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            How might we better reach those who most need free citizenship services from libraries in their communities?
          </li>
          <li>
            How might we better help immigrants with the paperwork and documentation steps of the citizenship process via libraries?
          </li>
          <li>
            How might we reduce linguistic and cultural barriers for immigrants utilizing the citizenship services at libraries?
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          We then brainstormed at least 30 ideas per How Might We statement, thinking of all different cases -- even ‚Äúwild‚Äù ideas. For each <i>How Might We</i> statement, 
          we voted on our top five ideas and analyzed key stakeholders, risks, and potential PIT biases for each of the five in order to choose a final design path.
        </p>

        <!-- HOW MIGHT WE #1 -->

        <p class="padtop">
          Moreover, we identified and analyzed existing solutions for immigrant support services.
        </p>
        <img src="images/ExistingSolutions1.png" class="u-max-full-width center" alt="">
        <img src="images/ExistingSolutions2.png" class="u-max-full-width center padtop" alt="">

        <p class="padtop">
          Thus, from the risk analyses and analyses of existing solutions, we decided to narrow our focus to three top ideas:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            An online citizenship corner
          </li>
          <li>
            A form / document logging app
          </li>
          <li>
            An interactive tutorial of how to fill the application forms
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          When deciding which ideas to pursue and prototype, we carefully considered the potential PIT biases and issues each idea 
          came with. For example, an unintended consequence of a buddy system solution could be that by failing to represent enough 
          countries, and in this case we add barriers to the citizenship process instead of reducing them. How can we prevent leaving 
          out individuals who don‚Äôt have access to computers or smartphones? Which platform is the most accessible? We learned that it 
          was smartphones over computers. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Our goal was to design a solution that would make a lasting impact on at least one person, but we wanted to make sure that our 
          idea would not increase barriers and reduce accessibility for any other persons. <strong>Thus, the main key PIT questions that guided 
          the direction of our design was who might we be leaving out in our solutions?</strong> This question pushed us to reflect on how we can 
          design a solution that reconciles the potential exclusions with the goal of helping at least one person first without further 
          perpetuating the problem.

        <h5><b>PROTOTYPING üí°</b></h5>

        <p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
        <p>
          After synthesizing our research, we had a long list of potential products that we could work on and move forward with. We ended up 
          settling on a mobile checklist app that would help users keep track of all the documents they might need when applying for citizenship.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key question that guided this design was: 
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How might we better help immigrants with the paperwork and documentation steps of the citizenship process via libraries?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Our research had shown that being <strong>overwhelmed</strong> was a common sentiment of users during the citizenship application process. 
          The checklist app would help users by making the document collection process app less overwhelming, more intuitive, and more 
          straightforward.
        </p>

        <p>
          The checklist app would help would-be citizens keep track of different documentation that might be required for citizenship applications or 
          interviews over time. The initial low-fi prototype was effectively just a re-organised physical checklist that broke the potential documents 
          required into different 'sections', but we soon realized that there was potential in reducing the complexity of the checklist even more by 
          <strong>personalizing</strong> the checklist to each user. For our medium-fi prototype, we included a set of questions, and after completing them, the user 
          would end up with a personalized checklist.
        </p>

        <p>
          This design idea also won out because it targeted a <strong>specific problem</strong> and did so in a deliberate and consolidated way. 
        </p>

        <p>
          A PIT question that guided this idea came up when we were thinking about whether an app or a website was the best route to go down for this idea: <strong>who might we be leaving out in our solutions?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Given that some of our interviewees were older, and some of the people we talked to were less digitally connected, we started to question whether an app was the right form that our solution should take. 
          Would it be more or less difficult for people to access? Would it be easier or harder for people with less tech literacy to use?
        </p>

        <p>
          We ultimately found that a lot of people have greater access to a smartphone than to a computer; some experts that we interviewed said that the target populations for this solution use smartphones and apps already.
        </p>

        <p class="padtop"><strong>OUR VISUAL / DESIGN LANGUAGE</strong></p>
        <p>
          Our main goal with our design was to ensure that the app did not make the process more difficult and overwhelming than a paper checklist, but instead streamlined that process and made it easier to follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an iteration from our low-fi prototype, we decided to have one question per page, with a large typeface that made the question clear, straightforward, and easy to consider. Since most questions required just a yes or a no answer, 
          buttons were fairly large; each page was dedicated to one question, and so attention could be isolated to each step. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We also made use of colour to help indicate progress ‚Äî once the user finished all the questions, they were greeted to a green screen that told them their checklist was being generated.
        </p>
        <p>
          And finally, our checklist screen used colour and separation of documents into separate groups to help distinguish between different types of documents.

        <h5><b>TESTING üß™</b></h5>
        <p>
          Throughout our testing process, one question around public interest technology that influenced our design was:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            How do we provide information and solutions that are both simple and clear while also being accurate and reliable to our users?
          </strong>
        </p>

        <p><strong>1. EARLY TEST OF A CITIZENSHIP BUDDY APP</strong></p>
        <img src="images/testing.png" class="u-max-full-width center" alt="early citizen buddy app test">
        <p class="padtop">
          Testing of an early prototype, a citizenship buddy application, which would pair would-be citizens with those who have recently gone through the process, revealed that our target users did not have the need for community we anticipated they would. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>FINDINGS</strong></p>
        <img src="images/1-feedback.png" class="u-max-full-width center" alt="feedback">
        <p>
          From these testing sessions on an early prototype option, we learned that a buddy app would not be ideal to solve problems for those overlooked by the process. Instead, we focused on an idea related to the overwhelming paperwork in the naturalization process.
        </p>

        <p><strong>2. EARLY TEST OF A FORM FILLER APP</strong></p>
        <img src="images/test-formfiller.png" class="u-max-full-width center-50" alt="form filler test">
        <p class="padtop">
          Testing of a form-filler prototype, an idea we later moved on from, allowed us to test out the response to simplifying a form by showing one yes or no question per page.
        </p>
        <p><strong>FINDINGS</strong></p>
        <img src="images/2_finding.png" class="u-max-full-width center" alt="finding of form filler">
        <p>
          Though we did not believe this was the best app idea to pursue, we took away key findings about how to display complex, bureaucratic questions in a simple way and about accessibility of smartphones for our users from these tests and implemented them in our design. 
        </p>

        <p><strong>3. EARLY TEST OF A DOCUMENT CHECKLIST APP</strong></p>
        <p>
          In the prototype of the technology we decided to pursue, the customized document checklist application, we took into account important comments from our previous user testing, namely:
        </p>

          Our final design was an iOS app that was a fully-functional implementation of the medium-fi Figma prototype we had designed. 
          The app walks users through a list of questions to ensure eligibility for citizenship, then moves to a list of questions that 
          creates a personalized checklist for every user. All data is stored locally, so nothing is pushed to the cloud (which could 
          have posed a potential privacy concern).

        <h4><strong>REFLECTIONS üí≠</strong></h4>
        <img src="images/diamond.png" class="u-max-full-width center" alt="PIT design process">
        <p>
          In following the PIT Double Diamond design process for our project, we came out with the following main takeaways:
        </p>

        <p><strong>1. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES</strong></p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Given the nature of the important social issues we are trying to address in a PIT process, the potential impact 
            of unintended consequences could result in real harm to individuals in the community we are trying to assist, 
            and we therefore need to tread extra cautiously, develop an understanding of these potential harms, and design our solutions to avoid them. 
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since our product is geared towards immigrants, we need to be extremely cautious that its use will not in some way 
          derail someone‚Äôs citizenship process, causing harm to that individual and their family. One of the reasons we 
          ultimately discarded our ‚ÄúBuddy app‚Äù idea is that there‚Äôs a risk that the citizen volunteers could accidentally 
          provide misleading or incorrect information which could hamper the would-be citizen‚Äôs process or, worse yet, it 
          could potentially be used nefariously by people who are anti-immigration to mislead immigrants in their process of 
          naturalization. Given the potential for real harm, it was therefore essential that we focused on solutions that 
          minimize those risks, and ensure that we are providing accurate, clear, reliable information that immigrants can trust.
        </p>

        <p><strong>2. LIVED EXPERIENCES</strong></p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Since we are not designing a solution that any member of our team would use in the near-future, we do not have the 
            relevant lived experience to help guide our process and therefore need to elevate and prioritize the experience and 
            insights of people who are seeking citizenship.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The PIT design process helps us understand that often the people who design technology applications have their own biases 
          and limitations, and that those who design social services programs may not be from the same communities where the services 
          are most needed. Since no member of our team is currently in the process of seeking citizenship, it is therefore crucial 
          that we understand our own blindspots and make sure we are prioritizing the input and feedback we receive from our user 
          interviews over our own preconceptions of what we think the community may need, and make adjustments or pivot in a different 
          direction when necessary. 
        </p>

        <p><strong>3. OUTREACH CHALLENGES</strong></p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            The most vulnerable populations may be the hardest to design a solution for, because they are often hardest to reach. 
            We have to acknowledge the limitations of our network and who we can reach. Conducting a mapping exercise at the outset 
            could be useful in creating a targeted plan for outreach and communication. 
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we found it challenging to connect to the most disadvantaged populations - including those who do not have reliable 
          access to internet or phones, who do no‚Äôt speak the languages we speak, who are undocumented or could face deportation, who 
          are socially isolated, or have low or no literacy - we would advise future designers and developers to conduct a mapping 
          exercise where 1) the team maps out their own network, and who from the target population they can expect to reach from 
          their own connections, and 2) the team researches and maps out relevant social organizations and community institutions 
          that could help connect the team to the target populations. We would advise that the team lays out a plan for who to contact, 
          creates a timeline, and begins the process of reaching out to the network and organizations early. At the end, it is also 
          important to recognize the populations you were still unable to reach, and create an additional outreach plan for future 
          iterations of the product. This is a question and exercise that could potentially be added to the PIT Double Diamond process.
